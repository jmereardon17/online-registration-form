# Techdegree Project 3

For this project I had to build a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files, I had to build a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.

I went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to further enhance the project by adding additional placeholder text for the other text fields, the required attribute to other input fields, a background color for one of the main sections of the site, additional styling enhancements to the form like the transition property and background color fade in and out for focus states.

Browsers tested for compatibility:
